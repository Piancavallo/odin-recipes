    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A homemade Chili with the addition of macaroni and cheese = Chili Mac ‘n Cheese! This is terrifically moorish and a fabulous one pot meal. Super quick too! The key with this recipe is to turn the stove off as soon as the pasta is just cooked - it will keep cooking in the residual heat. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion , finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 red capsicum / bell pepper , chopped</li>
            <li>500g / 1 lb ground beef (mince) , I use lean</li>
            <li>800g / 28 oz crushed canned tomato</li>
            <li>420g / 14 oz can red kidney beans , drained</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (625 ml) beef broth (chicken broth also ok)</li>
            <li>250g / 8 oz elbow macaroni pasta (elbow pasta), uncooked</li>
            <li>2 cups (200g) shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, tasty cheese)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup coriander / cilantro finely chopped, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Spices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper or pure chilli powder (adjust spiciness to taste)</li>
            <li>2 tsp paprika powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp onion powder (can sub garlic powder)</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in large pot over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute. Then add capsicum and cook until onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go.</li>
            <li>Once the beef turns from red to brown, add remaining ingredients except cheese. Stir, bring to simmer, then turn the heat down to medium.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for 12 minutes or until the macaroni is al dente, meaning just cooked, still a tiny bit on the firm side. It should be saucy but not tons of liquid (see video).</li>
            <li>Turn the stove OFF but leave the pot on the stove. Stir through half the cheese – it should be a bit saucy. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Top with remaining cheese, put the lid back on and leave until the cheese melts - about 2 minutes (sauce will absorb further during this period).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with coriander, if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
